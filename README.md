# Predicting Bitcoin Price in Real-Time with PySpark and Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to use historical data to train a machine learning model capable of predicting Bitcoin prices in real-time based on new input data. The dataset includes various records such as OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) prices, Bitcoin trading volumes in BTC and USD, weighted prices, and timestamps from 2011 to 2021.

## Technologies Used

- *Programming Language:* Python 3.9.7
- *Libraries and Frameworks:*
	- *PySpark:* Processing large volumes of data and machine learning modeling.
	- *Pandas:* Data manipulation.
	- *NumPy:* Numerical operations.
	- *Seaborn:* Data visualization.
	- *Matplotlib:* Data visualization.
- *Environment:* Jupyter Notebook


## Conclusion

This project focuses on predicting Bitcoin prices using machine learning techniques with PySpark, leveraging and manipulating historical data to create a robust predictive model. The use of PySpark allows for efficient processing of large data volumes, while visualization libraries aid in data analysis and understanding.
